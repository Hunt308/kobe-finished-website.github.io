            <p>My name is Kobe Rosenberg. I was born and raised in Miami; Florida, and currently reside in Saint Augustine; Florida. Throughout my life, I have been captivated by the power of visual communication and its ability to create meaningful connections. In 2013, I learned to master Adobe programs starting with Illustration and Photoshop before expanding upon to other programs to fully benefit both my skills and the clients too. </p>
